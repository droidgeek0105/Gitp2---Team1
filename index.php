<p> This is Jesse's very lame contribution to test how Git works in a collaborative environment. </p>

<h2> What Jesse Thinks GCFCoders Is All About: </h2>
<p> For me personally, it's all about learning computer stuff that I have no idea how to do and struggling the whole time, but everyone is very nice and helpful anyways so I get to have fun. </p>
=======
<p> GCFcoders is about learning technology and using that technology to glorify God not only in our learning, but also in our workplace. </p>
